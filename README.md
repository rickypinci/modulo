# Modular Extra-functional Analysis of Software Architectural Design Models

Repository of MUTUAL: ModUlar exTra-fUnctional AnaLysis

## Abstract
Emerging applications such as collaborative and autonomous cyber-physical systems seek for innovative techniques that support extra-functional analysis as key concern to be considered.
The objective of this paper is to complement software architectural design models with a set of *modules* that are (i) representative of multiple extra-functional properties, and (ii) equipped with strategies aimed to establish rules of interaction among them in a feedback loop fashion.
We propose a novel methodology that builds upon the specification of extra-functional modules and enables the generation of design alternatives as outcome of an internal intertwining of different extra-functional analysis results.
A case study in the domain of a collaborative and autonomous network of sensors is presented, and experimental results show that software architects are supported in the selection of design alternatives by quantitative information. A comparison with an integrated model is performed, and we demonstrate the advantages of such a modular analysis.
